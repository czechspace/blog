Czech Space Office organizes a workshop for Czech scientific community on biological and astrobiological research. The aim is to apprise the participants with possibilities of realization of the experiments and forthcoming ESA challenges in usage of the International Space Station and terrestrial scientific equipment. Registration is open till 11th June 2013. The European Space Agency (ESA) is preparing series of calls for proposals on the usage of the International Space Station (ISS) and ground equipment for scientific experiments in biology and astrobiology. To set light to the planned calls CSO organize a seminar for Czech research departments in June. With regard to an extension of ISS operations till 2020, ESA decided to kick off an announcement to ensure the continuation of research in biology, human physiology and astrobiology. ILSRA (International Life Sciences Research Announcement) will be open to project proposals by the end of 2013. Selected experiments should be performed on board the ISS during the period of 2016 - 2020. This is therefore the last opportunity to get involved in the area of life sciences research on the ISS. Parallel to ILSRA there is going to be a possibility to submit an experiment proposal on an altitude sounding rocket. Another way to conduct a research in microgravity conditions is to use parabolic flights or special ground equipment such as drop towers or clinostats. The use of this equipment is possible within a permanently open announcement CORA, where the project proposals can be submited continuously. All of the above opportunities are realized under the ESA European Programme for Life and Physical Sciences in Space (ELIPS). ESA has decided to support the scientific community by organizing a seminar which will present in detail various opportunities available in ELIPS-4 programme. The seminar will be held 19th and 20th June 2013 at ESTEC in the Netherlands and will be accessible to all scientists from ESA Member States after their registration. Czech Space Office arranges 13th June 2013 at 9:30 am supporting workshop for the Czech scientific community, which will be held in the CSO conference room. The workshop is free and registration is open till 11th June 2013. Participants will be explained the basic information of upcoming challenges and funding opportunities in Czech conditions. The knowledge gained will help to identify the interests and needs of Czech institutions in the field of research in microgravity conditions and help them with any further communication with ESA.
