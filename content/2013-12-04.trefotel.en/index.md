Researching propagation of electromagnetic waves Project duration: 2009 až 2012 Project manager: Ing. Václav Kvičera, CSc. The influence of the real tropospheric environment on the characteristics of both optical and radio terrestrial links was examined. The research was based on results of complex measurements of optical, radio and meteorological parameters. Experimental research of electromagnetic wave propagation was carried out on terrestrial radio links working at 58 GHz and 93 GHz and optical links at 850 nm and 1 550 nm. Meteorological parameters such as atmospheric visibility, liquid water content of fog, integrated particle areas in fog and rain intensities were measured. The obtained statistical distributions and dynamic characteristics were available for modelling in the frame of the WG3 working party of the international scientific cooperation COST IC0802. Dependences of the availability performances of both optical and radio links on the real atmospheric parameters such as fog, rain, snow and other hydrometeors were studied. Results obtained were compared with a few current models that parameters were specified. New model describing optical and radio terrestrial wireless channel was designed. Frequency diversity was studied to mitigate the adverse propagation conditions. Seven contributions for Management Committee meeting were created during the project in the frame of the international cooperation COST Action IC0802. Moreover, 22 papers for significant international conferences, 12 paper for impacted scientific journals and 2 contributions for Study Group 3 of the Radiocommunication Sector of International Telecommunication Union were published. The Czech Metrology Institute (CMI) The Institute provides services in all major categories of the fundamental and legal metrology. Department of frequency engineering deals with frequency planning, international coordination of TV and radio networks, microwave links, point-to-multipoint systems, analysis of signal coverage and the interference in radio-communication networks, calculation and study of electromagnetic compatibility of radio-communication services, analysis of the air navigation by VKV FM transmitters, the spectrum utilization in the Czech Republic in the framework of European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations and International Telecommunication Union, consultancy, research in the relevant field, research of the electromagnetic waves propagation in microwave and optical bands. What would you name as main benefits of the project to you an your company? “We really appreciated the active collaboration not only with foreign workplaces like Graz University of Technology in Austria, Italian National Research Council IEIIT – CNR and Politecnico di Milano in Italy, National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences, Pakistan Institute of Laser and Optics and COMSATS Institute of Information Technology in Pakistan, but also with the Institute of Atmospheric Physics at Czech Academy of Sciences and the Faculty of Electrical Engineering of Czech Technical University in Prague that produced several joint contributions published at conferences and in journals. The project manager was also working in four groups of SG3 at Radiocommunication Sector of International Telecommunication Union were published. Collaboration at this level was very useful thanks to the possibility to participate on top-class tasks related to preparation of documents for calculation and planning of fixed communication links.”
