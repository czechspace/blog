Prague, Vienna, November 14th, 2014 - Czech Space Office (CSO) and Space Generation Advisory Council (SGAC) have signed a Memorandum of Understanding today. Both organisations have common interests in promoting space activities and strengthening the space sector’s workforce through career development, education and outreach, and this Memorandum is the signature of the commitment both agreed on accomplishing such a goal in the Czech Republic. SGAC is a non-profit organisation that represents students and young professionals in the space sector to the United Nations, States, agencies, industry, academia and other space sector organisations. The organisation’s focus is providing pragmatic space policy advice to policy makers based on the interests of its network of university students and young professionals, in the age range of 18-35 from around the world, interested in space. This international network is the largest and most diverse of its kind, and it is growing constantly. The agreed activities include joint outreach and awareness programs or the organization of conferences, projects and workshops. Both organizations will also share information and promote each other's activities. CSO and SGAC are non-profit organizations, and therefore they are trying to find a sponsor that would allow to organise a competition for Czech students. In this competition, students would be asked to do a research and write a paper on a given topic. The winner would receive an award in order to attend and give a presentation at the International Astronautical Congress and Space Generation Congress next October in Jerusalem. Another planned activity is the conference focused on the activities of and for the Czech students and young professionals in the space sector. "The signing of this Memorandum of Understanding is an opportunity for Czech students and young professionals to break into the international community and engage in international activities," says Michal Kuneš, the Czech Space Office representative and SGAC National Point of Contact in the Czech Republic. "We are not focused only on the international community, we want to support also the building of national community of the Czech students and young professionals, enabling them to share information and collaborate on joint projects," concludes Michal Kuneš.
