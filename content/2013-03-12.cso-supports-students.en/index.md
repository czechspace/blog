Prague, March 12th – Space enthusiasts are likely to have a busy time this year. Like in previous years, there are many programs with support of the Czech Space Office available for them. Space education opportunities are available for kids of all age starting from kindergarten to university students. Starting with the 10th anniversary of “Expedition Mars – Learn Space” in April, this knowledge competition is suitable for young space fans. There is a broad offer of summer schools, internships and courses designed for high school and university students. The smallest kids may compete for the best name of the mascot of the European Space Agency (ESA). “We make effort to raise an interest of students in astronautics and natural sciences and continue to support their enthusiasm. Thanks to the Czech ESA membership, students can evaluate and compare their capabilities in the international environment. If our students try hard, they also have the opportunity to visit important world space centres or try a real astronauts training”, says Milan Halousek, the head of education department of the Czech Space Office. On April 12th at the anniversary of the first human flight to space, the 10th anniversary of the international knowledge competition Expedition Mars – Learn Space will be officially kicked off. It is designed for young 10 to 17 years old space enthusiasts. This competition will be inaugurated by the first European cosmonaut Vladimir Remek and by other important guests. The final part of this competition will be completed in autumn this year with the journey of the 12member crew into the training centre of young astronauts in Transine in Belgium. Successful participants will have the opportunity to try out a training simulator similar to one used by real astronauts. The dreams of four young students from Prague and Kladno may come true in May this year, as they are going to take part on a ceremony in San Diego, where the final results of an international competition for the best design of a big space station will be announced. They are going to introduce results of their work at the student “International Space Development Conference”, organized by NASA. High school and university students and professionals may also take part on several summer schools and courses this year. University students are invited to take part on the summer schools in Austrian Alps with emphasis on the space weather and in Davos, with focus on global navigation systems. College math and physics students are invited to take part on European space camp, which takes place at the launch place in Andoya in Norway. There is a competition for the best name of a ESA mascot the for youngest space enthusiasts. This competition is suited for children from four to twelve years old, who are citizens of ESA member states. The application to this competition can be sent also in Czech language. Ten most successful proposals will be awarded.
