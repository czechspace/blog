Czech supply into GSE RESPOND project Project duration: 2007 to 2010 Project manager: Tomáš Soukup The purpose of the European GSE RESPOND project is to speed-up and enhance efficiency of international humanitarian aid to areas struck by natural disasters and other crises, by use of proper and reliable geoinformation products based on satellite imagery. Gisat joined the project only in its second phase and contributed by geoinformation products supporting mostly Czech non-profit humanitarian organizations People in Need and ADRA. On the international scale the users are UN agencies (UNOSAT, WHO. UNDSS) and the World Bank. During the project there were developed 179 mapping products, out of which almost half was dedicated to help the African continent, one third for the Middle East and a fifth for Asia. Two thirds of products were utilized by Czech humanitarian organizations and the rest by UN and the World Bank users. The big challenge for the company was the large volume of satellite data to be processed. It was recognized, that easy availability of satellite data is for crisis management projects a critical factor. During the project cycle Gisat underwent several independent validations of its products by DLR, Infoterra UK, Sertit and Telespazio partners. The project supported the integration of Gisat into international community of geoinformation companies and helped to foster relationships with the Czech users. The company continues working in the emergency field by participation in the European project SAFER, GMES Emergency response Service. Gisat The company was founded in 1990 as a first in Czech Republic providing geoinformation services in the area of remote sensing.
