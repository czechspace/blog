14th March 2013, the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports (MEYS) organizes a seminar on ESA Earth Observation programmes in collaboration with the European Space Agency (ESA), Czech Space Office (CSO) and Ministry of Transport. A programme focused on Remote Sensing is divided into two components - the objective of the Earth Explorer component is the development of scientific satellites Earth Explorers, while the Development and Exploitation component includes preparatory activities for Earth Explorer missions or other missions of Earth Observation developed within ESA programmes (EOPA element - Earth Observation Preparatory Activities), the development of instruments for these missions (IPD element - Instrument Pre-Development), the Support to Science Element (STSEM), Scientific Exploitation of Operational Missions (SEOM), Level 2 Products (L2), Data User Element (DUE) and Value Adding Element (VAE) supports the scientific use of data from earth observation satellites (especially Earth Explorer) and developing of applications based on these data. Due to the composition the programme is a great opportunity for involvement in both of the areas – the Earth Sciences and the development of instruments, satellite platforms, ground segment and processing of remote sensing data for use in various applications. The contribution of the Czech Republic to the EOEP, which is paid from the budget of the Ministry of Education, is 4.23 million for the period of 2013 - 2016. The seminar will be conducted in English. Please confirm your participation till 12th March 2013 on email ondrej.novak@msmt.cz. If interested in a bilateral meeting note this fact your email.
